          <p>
            I am a Taiwanese software developer that speaks fluent English and Mandarin. My passion is creating awesome tech that are
            impactful around me, such as a convenient discord bot that can help my friends get the popularity ranking of each custom emojis
            or a beautiful commission webpage for my awesome artist friend. I also love learning new technologies because learning makes me
            a better thinker and finer problem solver.
          </p>
          <p>When I'm not coding or solving problems, I am most likely be drawing, watching movies, or playing badminton.</p>
